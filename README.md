## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

```
A poet of the computerâ€™s art,

I seek to understand systems, compilers, and networking.

The mysteries of low level and low latency systems,

Are what I most desire to unravel and explore.

In the world of computer science, I thrive,

As I dedicate myself to learning and growth.
